# 🚀 Selenium Automation Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my **Selenium Automation Portfolio**!  
This repository is a central hub showcasing my learning journey and projects — starting from **Java fundamentals**, moving into **basic Selenium frameworks**, and progressing towards **intermediate and advanced automation frameworks**.  

I’ve structured my work to reflect my growth as an Automation Engineer — from learning the foundations to building scalable test frameworks.

## 📌 Projects

### 1. [selenium-java-framework](https://github.com/AbarnaSelv/selenium-java-framework) _(Learning Phase Project)_
This is my **first Selenium project**, built while following Koushik’s YouTube tutorials.  
It represents my **learning phase** where I started with **Java basics** and progressed into Selenium automation.

**Java topics covered:**
- Variables, Methods, Constructors, Arrays, Data types  
- Static variables & methods, Variable types  
- Inheritance, Abstract classes, Interfaces  
- Exception Handling  
- Collections (basic to advanced)  

**Tech stack used in this project:**
- Java (Core + OOP concepts)  
- Selenium **3.141.59**  
- TestNG **6.14.2**  
- Page Object Model (POM)  
- Cucumber (BDD)  

📌 *This project is the foundation of my Selenium learning journey.*  

📌 **Note:** This project does **not include screenshots or videos** as it was part of my initial learning journey.

### 2. [SeleniumLoginAutomation](https://github.com/AbarnaSelv/SeleniumLoginAutomation) _(Beginner Level Project)_
A **compact, beginner-friendly** Selenium automation project demonstrating a **professional structure** with simple test flows.  

**Tech stack:**
- Java 17  
- Selenium 4  
- TestNG  
- Page Object Model (PageFactory)  
- Maven for dependency management  

**Implemented Test Flows:**
1. **Login** → Authenticate into the site  
2. **Logout** → Open menu & logout (with explicit waits)  
3. **Add product to cart → verify → logout** → Add *Sauce Labs Backpack* to cart, validate, and logout  

📌 *This repo demonstrates Selenium basics with proper project setup.*
