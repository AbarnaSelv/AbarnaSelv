# Selenium Automation Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my **Selenium Automation Portfolio**!  
This repository is a central hub showcasing my learning journey and projects — starting from **Java fundamentals**, moving into **basic Selenium frameworks**, and progressing towards **intermediate and advanced automation frameworks**.  

I’ve structured my work to reflect my growth as an Automation Engineer — from learning the foundations to building scalable test frameworks.

## Projects

### 1. [selenium-java-framework](https://github.com/AbarnaSelv/selenium-java-framework) _(Learning Phase Project)_
This is my **first Selenium project**, built while following Koushik’s YouTube tutorials.  
It represents my **learning phase** where I started with **Java basics** and progressed into Selenium automation.

**Java topics covered:**
- Variables, Methods, Constructors, Arrays, Data types  
- Static variables & methods, Variable types  
- Inheritance, Abstract classes, Interfaces  
- Exception Handling  
- Collections (basic to advanced)  

**Tech stack used in this project:**
- Java (Core + OOP concepts)  
- Selenium **3.141.59**  
- TestNG **6.14.2**  
- Page Object Model (POM)  
- Cucumber (BDD)  

*This project is the foundation of my Selenium learning journey.*  

**Note:** This project does **not include screenshots or videos** as it was part of my initial learning journey.

### 2. [SeleniumLoginAutomation](https://github.com/AbarnaSelv/SeleniumLoginAutomation) _(Beginner Level Project)_
A **compact, beginner-friendly** Selenium automation project demonstrating a **professional structure** with simple test flows.  

**Tech stack:**
- Java 17  
- Selenium 4  
- TestNG  
- Page Object Model (PageFactory)  
- Maven for dependency management  

**Implemented Test Flows:**
1. **Login** → Authenticate into the site  
2. **Logout** → Open menu & logout (with explicit waits)  
3. **Add product to cart → verify → logout** → Add *Sauce Labs Backpack* to cart, validate, and logout  

*This repo demonstrates Selenium basics with proper project setup.*

### 3. [FormSubmissionAutomation](https://github.com/AbarnaSelv/FormSubmissionAutomation) _(Next-Level Basics)_
This project extends my Selenium basics into **real-world form interactions**.  

**Tech stack:**
- Java 17  
- Selenium 4  
- TestNG  
- Page Object Model (POM with PageFactory)  
- Maven  

**Scenarios Covered:**
- Login & password  
- Disabled & Read-only input fields  
- Dropdowns, Radio buttons, Checkboxes  
- File upload  
- Color picker, Date picker, Range slider  
- Submitting the form  

*A lightweight, modular framework — designed for scalability & faster test development.*

### 4. [Automation-on-ECommerceCart](https://github.com/AbarnaSelv/Automation-on-ECommerceCart) _(Intermediate Project)_
An **intermediate-level Selenium automation framework** designed for testing the **end-to-end flow of an e-commerce application**.  

**Features implemented:**
- Login → Add products to cart → Checkout → Verify order success → Logout  
- Page Object Model (POM)  
- WebDriverManager for automatic driver handling  
- Utility classes for screenshots & reusable methods  
- TestNG Listeners for logging and execution tracking  
- Extent Reports for **professional HTML reporting**  
- Default TestNG `test-output` reports  
- `.gitignore` included for clean version control  

*This project focuses on framework design, reusability, and reporting.*

### 5. [orangehrm-automation-framework](https://github.com/AbarnaSelv/orangehrm-automation-framework) _(Advanced Level Project)_
This is an **advanced data-driven automation testing framework** built for **OrangeHRM (opensource demo site)**.  
It demonstrates **end-to-end automation** of core HRMS features such as login and **employee management (PIM module)**, aligning with **real-world enterprise automation practices**.

**Tech stack:**
- Java  
- Selenium WebDriver  
- Cucumber (BDD)  
- TestNG  
- Page Object Model (POM)  
- Maven  
- Jenkins 

**Key Features:**
- **Data-driven testing** with Excel  
- **Cross-browser execution**  
- **Reusable utility classes**  
- **Professional reports** (Extent Reports + Cucumber HTML)  
- **Jenkins compatibility** → Framework is designed to be easily integrated with Jenkins pipelines for automated execution  
- Screenshots & Videos included in repo  

This project highlights **scalability, maintainability, and enterprise-level framework design**.
