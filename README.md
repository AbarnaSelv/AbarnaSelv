# Automation Testing Portfolio

This repository presents a collection of **Automation Testing projects**, covering both **UI and API testing**.  
It highlights a progression from **Java fundamentals** to **Selenium automation frameworks** and further into **REST Assured API testing**.  

The projects demonstrate growth in building **scalable, maintainable, and enterprise-ready automation frameworks**.

This is my **first Selenium project**, created while following Koushik’s tutorials.  
It focuses on applying **Java fundamentals** to practical Selenium automation tasks, providing a **strong foundation for building automation frameworks**.

**Java topics covered:**
- Variables, Methods, Constructors, Arrays, Data types  
- Static variables & methods, Variable types  
- Inheritance, Abstract classes, Interfaces  
- Exception Handling  
- Collections (basic to advanced)

### 6. [RESTAssuredAutomation](https://github.com/AbarnaSelv/RESTAssuredAutomation) _(API & Automation Testing)_
This project demonstrates **API automation testing** using REST Assured, complementing my Selenium work.

**Highlights:**
- API CRUD operations: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE  
- JSON and XML schema validation  
- SOAP request handling  
- Maven-based project structure for easy dependency management  
- Test execution videos and project screenshots included  

*Structured for clarity, reusability, and real-world API testing practices.*
